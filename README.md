<h5> Idea </h5>
Upload your exported data from <a href="http://www.mint.com">Mint</a>, this app will automatically generate rich data visualizations of your spending habits. This allows you to pinpoint where you can save and where you can splurge. Continuously uploading data will allow you to have a full picture of your yearly or even multi-yearly trends.

<h5>Purpose</h5>
To practice a number of Javascript technologies that I am interested in: Node/Express, React, and D3.

## Obviously, a work in progress and nowhere near functional
